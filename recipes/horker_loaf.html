    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>While horker meat might not be everyone's first pick, it
        sustains many a coastal family. It's considered lucky to eat 
        the roasted garlic "tusks" at the top of the loaf, and children
        will often compete with one another to get them
    </p>


    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>One 3.75-ounce tin smoked oysters</li>
        <li>Garlic Cloves, Divided - 5</li>
        <li>Large Carrot, Peeled and Chopped - 1</li>
        <li>Ground Beef - 1 1/2 pounds</li>
        <li>Breadcrumbs - 1/2 cup</li>
        <li>Heavy Cream - 1/3 cup</li>
        <li>Egg - 1</li>
        <li>Stormcloak Seasoning - 1 teaspoon</li>
        <li>Salt - 1 teaspoon</li>
        <li>Pepper - 1 teaspoon</li>
        <li>Bacon - 5 slices</li>
    </ul>


    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 425Â°F and line a baking sheet with
            parchment paper</li>
            <br>
        <li>Mince 2 cloves of the garlic, then ulse the oyster, minced garlic, 
            and carrot several times in a food processor until there are no large 
            chunks. In a large bowl, combie the pureed mixture with the 
            ground beef, breadcrumbs, heavy cream, egg, Stormcloack Seasoning, 
            salt, and pepper. Mix thoroughly, then form into a slightly oblong 
            dome, no higher than 4 inches, on the preared baking sheet.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>Gently press the 3 remaining garlic cloves into the top of the loaf. 
            Then, working from just next to the garlic, begin laying the bacon 
            slices across the short side of the loaf, 2 on each side. Lay one final 
            strip over the garlic to keep it from burning.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>Bake for about 40 minutes. Peel back the top piece of bacon to reveal
            the garlic tusks before serving.
        </li>
    </ol>
